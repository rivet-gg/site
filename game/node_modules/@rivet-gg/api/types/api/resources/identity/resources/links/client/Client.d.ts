     * Begins the process for linking an identity with the Rivet Hub.
     * # Importance of Linking Identities
     * When an identity is created via `rivet.api.identity#SetupIdentity`, the identity is temporary
     * and is not shared with other games the user plays.
     * In order to make the identity permanent and synchronize the identity with
     * other games, the identity must be linked with the hub.
     * # Linking Process
     * The linking process works by opening `identity_link_url` in a browser then polling
     * `rivet.api.identity#GetGameLink` to wait for it to complete.
     * This is designed to be as flexible as possible so `identity_link_url` can be opened
     * on any device. For example, when playing a console game, the user can scan a
     * QR code for `identity_link_url` to authenticate on their phone.
