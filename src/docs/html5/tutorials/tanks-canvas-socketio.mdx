The following guide will walk you through integrating and deploying a game with Rivet.

--- */}

## Step 1: Setup project

Run the following to clone the repository and start the server:

```bash
git clone -b pre-rivet https://github.com/rivet-gg/examples
cd javascript/tanks-socketio-canvas
npm run start
```

<PreRivetBranch></PreRivetBranch>

This will open your browser to http://localhost:8080. Verify the game works.

### Initialize project

<InstallCli />

Run the following command to setup your project:

```bash
rivet init --html5
```

<WhatDoesRivetDo />

### Update the config

You can configure your game's Rivet config in the created `rivet.yaml` file. For the purposes of this demo,
you can copy and paste this config into your file:

  ```yaml {{"file": "rivet.yaml"}}
  scripts:
    start: npm run start

  # How the game lobbies run and how players connect to the game.
  #
  # https://docs.rivet.gg/matchmaker/introduction
  matchmaker:
    # How many players can join a specific lobby.
    #
    # Read more about matchmaking: https://docs.rivet.gg/matchmaker/concepts/finding-lobby
    max_players: 32

    # The hardware to provide for lobbies.
    #
    # Available tiers: https://docs.rivet.gg/serverless-lobbies/concepts/available-tiers
    tier: basic-1d1

  # Which regions the game should be available in.
  #
  # Available regions: https://docs.rivet.gg/serverless-lobbies/concepts/available-regions
  matchmaker:
    regions:
      atl: {}
      fra: {}

    # Runtime configuration for the lobby's Docker container.
    docker:
      # If you're unfamiliar with Docker, here's how to write your own
      # Dockerfile:
      # https://docker-curriculum.com/#dockerfile
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

      # Which ports to allow players to connect to. Multiple ports can be defined
      # with different protocols.
      #
      # How ports work: https://docs.rivet.gg/serverless-lobbies/concepts/ports
      ports:
        default:
          port: 3000

    # What game modes are available.
    #
    # Properties like `max_players`, `tier`, `dockerfile`, `regions`, and more can
    # be overridden for specific game modes.
    game_modes:
      default: {}

  # How Rivet CDN should host your static assets on our CDN.
  #
  # https://docs.rivet.gg/cdn/introduction
  cdn:
    # Command to run before uploading the site to Rivet. This can be used to
    # build any JavaScript bundles or generate assets.
    build_command: npm install && npm run build:client:prod

    # The folder to upload to Rivet.
    #
    # If you're hosting a website, ensure that `index.html` is in the root of
    # this folder.
    build_output: ./dist/

  kv: {}

  identity: {}
  ```

## Step 2: Integrate Rivet Matchmaker

### Install `@rivet-gg/api`

Run the following to install the library to interact with Rivet:

```bash
npm i @rivet-gg/api --save
```

### Update the client

Add the following to the top of `client/Client.ts`:

```typescript client/Client.ts
import { RivetClient } from '@rivet-gg/api';
const RIVET = new RivetClient({ token: process.env.RIVET_TOKEN });
```

<EnvTokenClient />

Find the `connect` function in `client/Client.ts` and replace it with the following:

```typescript client/Client.ts
async function connect(client: Client) {
  // Find a lobby to connect to on Rivet
  let res = await RIVET.matchmaker.lobbies.find({ gameModes: ['default'] });
  let port = res.ports['default'];

  // Open a new connection to the lobby
  client.connection = new Connection(client, port.isTls, port.host, {
    token: res.player.token
  });
}
```

### Update the server

Add the following to the top of `server/index.ts`:

```typescript server/index.ts
import { RivetClient } from '@rivet-gg/api';
const RIVET = new RivetClient({ token: process.env.RIVET_TOKEN });

// Notify Rivet that this lobby is ready to accept players
RIVET.matchmaker.lobbies.ready();
```

<EnvTokenServer />

Find the `setupConnection` function in `server/index.ts` and replace it with the following:

```typescript server/index.ts
async function setupConnection(socket: Socket) {
  // Read the token passed to the socket query
  let playerToken = socket.handshake.query.token as string;

  // Validate the player token with the matchmaker
  await RIVET.matchmaker.players.connected({ playerToken });

  // Remove the player when disconnected
  socket.on('disconnect', () => RIVET.matchmaker.players.disconnected({ playerToken }));

  new Connection(game, socket);
}
```

### Run with Rivet

Finally, after stopping the previous `npm run start`, run `rivet run start` and validate the game still connects.

<Accordion title='What is "rivet run"?'>
  The `rivet run` command automatically adds important environment variables required for running a game to
  whatever script you choose to run with it. In this case, it is reading the `start` script defined in
  `rivet.yaml`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Optional: Check for connectivity to Rivet'>
  1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on macOS) to open the dev tools.
  2. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
  3. Refresh your page.
  4. Find a `POST` request to `https://api.rivet.gg/matchmaker/lobbies/find`. This means you are
    successfully connected through Rivet.

  <Image className="block ml-auto mr-auto" src={postRequest} width={500} alt='Successful POST request' />
</Accordion>

## Step 3: Deploy to Rivet

Now that you managed to get the game running locally, you can deploy your game to Rivet with:

```bash
rivet deploy prod
```

<Accordion title='What does this do?'>
  - Builds & uploads your Docker image for [Rivet Dynamic Servers](/docs/dynamic-servers/index)
  - Builds & uploads your site for [Rivet CDN](/docs/cdn)
  - Creates a version on Rivet and deploys the version to the *Production* namespace
</Accordion>

The CLI will print a link ending in `rivet.game`. Share the link with a friend to play your game on Rivet! ðŸŽ‰
