# Step 1: Setup Unreal Engine project

We'll use the third-person template from Unreal Engine. All the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other Unreal Engine games.

<Warning>
  If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your project is version controlled before
  making any changes.
</Warning>

## Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry

We need to authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) to be able to pull the Unreal Engine Docker image.

1. Make sure you already have Unreal Engine GitHub Access [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github).
2. Authenticate with [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic).

## Create project from template (or bring your own project)

1. Create a third-person template with the C++ version. We'll create a guide for using Blueprints instead of C++ soon.
2. Set _Quality Preset_, _Starter Content_, and _Raytracing_ to anything.
3. Click _Create_.
	<Image src={imgCreateThirdPerson} alt='Third person create dialog' />
4. Open the Visual Studio project by clicking _Tools > Open Visual Studio_.
	<Image src={imgOpenVisualStudio} alt='Open visual studio' />

## Add server target

We need to add a target so you can compile your game as a dedicated server to run on Rivet.

Create a file at `Source/MyProjectServer.Target.cs` with the following. Replace `MyProject` with your project's name.

```csharp {{"file": "Source/MyProjectServer.Target.cs"}}
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectServerTarget : TargetRules
{
	public MyProjectServerTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
	{
		Type = TargetType.Server;
		DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
		IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_1;
		ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyProject");
	}
}
```
