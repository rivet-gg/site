# Step 3: Build game menu UI

We will build a simple menu UI that will allow players to connect to a server. This will be the first thing players see when they start the game. We will also update the default map to be the menu UI instead of the game world.

## Create the menu UI world

1. Create a new level in _File -> New Level..._
2. Select _Empty Level_
3. Click _File -> Save Current Level_ or press _Ctrl + S_. Save in _All/Content/Third Person/Maps_ and name it _Entry_.
4. Change the game mode by clicking the Blueprint dropdown and then clicking _World Override -> Game Mode: Not overridden! -> Select GameModeBase Class -> GameModeBase_ - This will remove the game mode logic to create a pure menu screen
   <Image src={imgSetGameModeBase} alt='Set game mode base' />

## Create the menu widget

1. Open the _Content Drawer_
2. Open _All/Content/ThirdPerson/UI_
   - You may have to create this folder
3. Right-click in the content area and click _User Interface -> Widget Blueprint_
   <Image src={imgCreateWidgetBlueprint} alt='Create widget blueprint' />
4. Click _User Widget_
   <Image src={imgUserWidget} alt='User widget' />
5. Rename it to _EntryWidget_

## Design menu widget

<CrashCourseUnrealWidget />

1. Open the _EntryWidget_ you created
2. Construct the following design:
   <Image src={imgEntryWidgetDesign} alt='Entry widget design' />

## Write widget blueprint to connect to server when button is clicked

<CrashCourseUnrealBlueprint />

1. Create a development token by running the following command and copying the token. It should look like `dev_staging.XXXX`. Save this for the next step.
   ```bash
   rivet token dev create
   ```
2. Open the Blueprint code for the _EntryWidget_ you created by clicking _Graph_ in the top right corner
   - Replace `MY_TOKEN` with the token you just created.
3. Construct the following Blueprint:
   <Image src={imgEntryWidgetBlueprint} alt='Entry widget blueprint' />
4. Press _Compile_

This widget can now be used to connect a player to a server.

## Add the menu widget to the entry level

1. Open the level Blueprint by clicking the Blueprint dropdown and then clicking _Open Level Blueprint_
   <Image src={imgOpenLevelBlueprint} alt='Open level blueprint' />
2. Construct the following Blueprint:
   <Image src={imgEntryLevelBlueprint} alt='Entry level blueprint' />
3. Press _Compile_

## Update the default map

Now that we have a new _Entry_ map for the UI, we need to make it the default map.

1. Open _Edit -> Project Settings..._
2. Click on _Maps & Modes_ under _Projects_ in the sidebar
   - You can also search for "map" in the search bar
3. Change _Game Default Map_ to _/Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/Entry_
4. Change _Advanced > Server Default Map_ to _/Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/ThirdPersonMap_

## Set up play configuration for testing multiplayer

We will configure the play settings to test the game with Rivet locally in your editor.

1. Press the three dots next to the play button and click _Advanced Settings_ to open the _Play In_ settings.

   <Image src={imgPlaySettings} alt='Play settings' />

2. Scroll down to _Multiplayer Options_. Update the following settings:

   - **Launch Separate Server**: False
   - **Play Net Mode**: Play Standalone
   - **Run Under One Process**: True
     <Image src={imgMultiplayerOptionsSettings} alt='Multiplayer options settings' />

3. Update the number of players to at least 2.

   <Image src={imgNumberPlayers} alt='Change number of players' />

## Test the game server locally

**Run server**

This will build & run your game server locally and run on port 7777. You must re-run this command whenever you change your server code.

```bash
rivet unreal start-server
```

**Run client**

1. Switch to the main editor
2. Validate that the _Entry_ level is open
3. Click _Play_
4. Click _Connect_ in each of the game instances created
5. You should be able to see each player running around in sync

<Image src={imgFinalDemo} alt='Final demo' />

This is using the Rivet development token to mock production APIs. This lets you test with production APIs while still using your local machine.
