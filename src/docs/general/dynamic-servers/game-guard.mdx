# Rivet Game Guard

Rivet Game Guard provides a layer of protection between the public internet and your game without impacting performance. You can think of like Cloudflare but for game traffic.

Game Guard serves two main purposes:

- DDoS mitigation
- SSL/TLS termination

## Supported protocols

## DDoS mitigation

Game Guard helps mitigate DDoS attacks by:

- Whitelisting IPs for players in the lobby
- Enforcing max open connections per IP
- Preventing OSI <Tooltip tip="e.g. IP, ICMP">layer 3</Tooltip> and <Tooltip tip="e.g. TCP, UDP">layer 4</Tooltip>
  malicious traffic from reaching your game server
- OSI <Tooltip tip='e.g. WebSocket, HTTP'>layer 7</Tooltip> rate limiting

### Where Game Guard cannot help

While Game Guard can help mitigate serious DDoS attacks, your game server may still be vulnerable to certain
kinds of attacks.

Make sure you are doing the following:

#### Disconnect invalid players

The Rivet Matchmaker has systems in place to ensure players are valid & optionally completed a captcha befor
issuing a player token. Ensure this player token is valid before letting a player connect to your game.

Disconnect sockets immediately if [matchmaker.players.connected](/docs/matchmaker/api/players/connected)
returns an error. Specifically:

- [MATCHMAKER_PLAYER_ALREADY_CONNECTED](/docs/general/errors/mm/player-already-connected)
- [MATCHMAKER_PLAYER_REGISTRATION_EXPIRED](/docs/general/errors/mm/player-registration-expired)
- [MATCHMAKER_PLAYER_REMOVED](/docs/general/errors/mm/player-removed)
- [MATCHMAKER_PLAYER_IN_DIFFERENT_LOBBY](/docs/general/errors/mm/player-in-different-lobby)
- [TOKEN_INVALID](/docs/general/errors/token/invalid)

Additionally, don't accept any packets from the client until [matchmaker.players.connected](/docs/matchmaker/api/players/connected) has succeeded.

#### Limit packet size & frequency

Game Guard mitigates attacks of high-volume packet spamming, but you will likely want to implement your own
packet rate limiting mechanism.

#### Still having issues?

No game on Rivet should be suffering from DDoS attacks if set up correctly.

If you're having issues with DDoS attacks on your game, [contact us](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH) and we'll
make sure your game is up and running.

## SSL/TLS termination

You may need to use secure WebSockets or TCP+TLS when connecting to your game servers. For example, HTTPS
websites require secure WebSockets or you may want to prevent [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)
exploits by encrypting your game traffic.

Supporting this yourself requires you to regularly issue and update your own SSL and TLS certificates. Game
Guard automatically manages SSL certificates for your game.

    **Why shouldn't I use something like Cloudflare for my game?**

    Cloudflare is great for protecting traditional web servers but does not work well for game traffic.

    - Cloudflare only supports WebSockets (unless using [Cloudflare Spectrum Enterprise](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/protocols-per-plan/))
    - Cloudflare does not respect long-lived WebSockets; players will be disconnected sporadically if connected
      for a long time
    - Cloudflare proxies game traffic through a different data center than where your game is running
    - Cloudflare adds at least 10 ms latency to your game

    **Game Guard SSL/TLS termination & game server CPU load reduction**

    It's widely known that SSL only causes a [negligible performance impact](https://blogs.sap.com/2013/06/23/whos-afraid-of-ssl/)
    on traditional HTTP traffic.

    However, when encrypting many packets per second for a real-time game, that performance impact can be
    noticeable (especially with poorly optimized libraries). We've seen CPU reductions in multiple games that
    move their SSL termination from the host to Game Guard.

    We choose not to advertise this feature yet since we have not published benchmarks to back this up yet,
    but we believe it's worth mentioning.
