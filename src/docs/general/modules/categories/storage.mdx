# Storage

Rivet provides two ways of storing persistent data:

- **Database** Store data that need to be queried in flexible ways (most common)
- **Game Saves** Game saves allow you to save game state
- **Uploads** Store large blobs of data

## Database

Rivet Database is used for storing frequently used data. This data can be queried in multiple ways depending on how you need to access the data.

Use the Rivet Database by writing schema & script for inserting/fetching data to ensure security & performance of your data.

Get starting using the Rivet Database [here](/docs/general/modules/build/database).

## Game Saves

Game saves allow you to save game state, similar to how writing to a file system would work if saving games locally.

Game saves can be used for use cases like open-world games, sandboxes, co-op progressions, and more.

Refer to the module documentation below for more information.
