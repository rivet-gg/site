This is configured to use UDP sockets with the
[Tugboat](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/components/transports/tugboat)
transport. WebGL requires the
[Bayou](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/components/transports/bayou)
transport, which is not included in this demo yet.

## Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 + Linux Dedicated Server build module
- Dedicated Server build module for your development platformg

## Getting started

### Installing the plugin

First, install the Rivet Plugin. There are
[several ways](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-unity?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation)
to do this, but we'll do it with the Git URL through the Unity Package Manager.

1. Open the Package Manager
2. Click the `+` button in the top left
3. Select `Add package from git URL`
4. Enter `https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-unity.git?path=Assets/Rivet`
5. Click `Add`

### Using the plugin

To open the Rivet Plugin, click `Window > Rivet > Rivet`. This will open the
plugin in a separate window. You can drag it to somewhere within the Unity
editor for easier access.

#### Sign in

The first thing you'll need to do in the plugin is sign in. Click the `Sign In`
button and follow the instructions. This will bring up the Rivet hub so that you
can select the game you want to connect the editor to.

#### Develop tab

Once you sign in, across the top of the plugin are several tabs. The `Develop`
tab is where you'll be able to start a local Unity server for testing, and
configure other settings.

#### Deploy tab

The deploy tab is used to build a containerized version of your game server, and
send it off to Rivet's cloud to run.
