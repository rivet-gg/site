# Quick Start
1. [Install the Rivet Unity plugin](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-unity)
2. Set up your Unity project
3. Deploy your game to Rivet servers

## Overview

The Rivet Unity plugin allows you to get a multiplayer game running quickly with Fish-Net networking, without complex setup. You can test locally and deploy to scalable cloud servers across multiple regions, all managed through the Unity editor.

<Warning title="Prerequisite">
  - Unity 2020.3 or newer
  - Linux Dedicated Server build module
  - Dedicated Server build module for your development platform
  - Docker installed on your system
</Warning>

5. Click "Add"

### 2. Access the Plugin

1. Open the Rivet plugin window by going to `Window > Rivet > Rivet`
2. You can dock this window within your Unity editor layout for easier access

### 3. Configure Your Project

1. **Sign In**:
   - Click the "Sign In" button in the plugin
   - Follow the steps to create an account or sign in
   - Select your game project through the Rivet hub

2. **Plugin Navigation**:
   The plugin interface contains several key tabs:
   - **Develop Tab**: Main development workspace
     - Start local Unity servers
     - Configure testing settings
     - Manage development environment

## Advance Networking Details

- This template uses Fish-Net for networking ([documentation](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/))
- Currently configured for UDP sockets using the Tugboat transport
- Note: WebGL builds require the Bayou transport (not included in current demo)

## Testing Your Game

1. Use the Develop tab to:
   - Start local server instances
   - Test multiplayer functionality
   - Configure development settings

2. Local Testing Options:
   - Run multiple clients
   - Test different network conditions
   - Debug server behavior

## Deployment

1. In the Deploy tab:
   - Build your server container
   - Select deployment target (Production/Staging)
   - Configure deployment settings
   - Monitor deployment progress

2. Post-Deployment:
   - Test the deployed version
   - Monitor server performance
   - Scale as needed

## Troubleshooting

- Verify Docker is properly installed and running
- Check Unity version compatibility
- Ensure all required build modules are installed
- Review logs in the Unity console and Rivet plugin
- Confirm network connectivity for cloud deployments

## Next Steps

- Customize the Fish-Net networking setup
- Add game-specific server logic
- Implement additional Rivet features
