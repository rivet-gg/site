# rivet.yaml Specification

## Naming

Workflow files must be name `rivet.yaml`, `rivet.toml`, or `rivet.json`. We recommend using YAML for your configuration since it is easiest to read/write and [provides validation & suggestions through our schema](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server).

## Namespacing

Rivet configs can override properties by naming them `rivet.{namespace}.yaml`. For example, you can configure your generic config in `rivet.yaml` and override the properties for production in `rivet.prod.yaml`.
