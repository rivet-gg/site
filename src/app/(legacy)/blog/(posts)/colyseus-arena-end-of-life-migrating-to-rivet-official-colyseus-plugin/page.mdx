Sadly, Colyseus Arena was [shut down](https://twitter.com/endel/status/1641204209952468992) with 48 hours notice to developers. (Deadline of March 31st.) For those that aren't familiar, Colyseus Arena was a managed hosting service for the open source [Colyseus JavaScript multiplayer framework](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus).

‍

Colyseus Arena has a lot of rich multiplayer games running on it, so we threw together an official Rivet plugin for Colyseus developers to keep their games up and running.

‍

The Rivet plugins for Colyseus are linked below:

- [Rivet + Colyseus Server Plugin](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-colyseus-server/blob/main/README.md)
- [Rivet + Colyseus Client](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-colyseus-javascript/blob/master/README.md)
- [Rivet + Colyseus Example Project](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-colyseus-examples)

‍

If you are migrating a game to Rivet, please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH) so we can help you accelerate the process!

‍

We hope that people continue to build games with the open source Colyseus framework in the future and that Rivet helps keep building multiplayer games accessible.
