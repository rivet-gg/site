## Bolt Namespace and Secret Management

In February, we added a way to store Bolt namespace configs and secrets inside
1password so that it's easier to share your cluster configuration with your
team. This only matters for Rivet Enterprise and Rivet Open Source, since Rivet
Cloud users don't need to touch the cluster themselves.

Internally at Rivet, this has allowed us to share the access to our production
clusters much more efficiently to our on-call team members. The main problem we
ran into before was if a secret was added, or changed, it was difficult to
propagate knowledge of that to each other. Now, Bolt will automatically check
for any changes that others have made to the configs!

## CLI Tips

We added a documentation page about tips for Rivet's command line interface
(CLI) (https://rivet.gg/docs/general/concepts/cli-tips). It includes lots of
detail about the functionality of the CLI:

- Navigating to the Rivet Hub from the CLI.
- `rivet run` and `rivet exec` to run scripts and commands in an environment with your tokens automatically configured.
- Making deployments of your game.
- Details about Docker, the Rivet CDN, and Continuous Integration with Rivet.

## Developing from an iPad

Rivet can now be developed on an iPad using GitHub Codespaces! The significance
of this is a bit nuanced; previously, developing Rivet required a VM with Debian
11 that would exclusively be used for Rivet's cluster. However, we recently
released a Devcontainer
(https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) that can run the
entire cluster. This still requires 32GB of ram on the host system (for the time
being), since the cluster uses quite a few resources, and Rust compilation +
Rust Analzyer take lots of ram.

However, GitHub Codespaces allows you to easily run Devcontainers on their
servers, which should lower the startup time significantly. Note however, GitHub
Codespaces cost $0.72 an hour for the lowest tier that Rivet can work on. If you
have your own machine with at least 32GB of ram and Docker installed, then you
can use it to develop on!
