As was mentioned in [our recent monthly
update](/blog/monthly-update-03-jan-2024), Rivet has launched in Open Beta! In
this post, we'll take a look at some of the features that are currently a part
of Rivet's platform, and see some of what's to come in the next few months.

{/* Would be cool to show off an example game with some fake number of players.

## Lobby Overview

{/* Show off several lobbies being used */}

## Engine Plugins

A big part of our open beta is not just having a solid and stable platform, but
also to bring our engine integrations to another level. We started by
overhauling our Godot plugin, and it is really to start being used! We created
new learning material for it, and you can find it on the [Godot plugin store](#TODO:)

## How to get started

## Pricing

We have several ways to get your game on Rivet. This consists of Cloud, Open
Source, and Enterprise. We'll focus on the Rivet Cloud, though you can learn
more about [self-hosting Open Source], or reach out to us if you have
[Enterprise needs](sales@rivet.gg).

On our pricing page, you can look at the dynamic server cost calculator. Prices
start at $2.85 for 1/8 of a dedicated core and 229MB, and to up to $22.76 for 1 dedicated
CPU.
