Rivet was built from day 1 to make sure you can iterate quickly on your multiplayer game without worrying about things breaking. We provide no downtime deploys that let you deploy and rollback your game without disconnecting players so you can move faster and worry less when things break.

The last thing we want is developers hunting for the last version they deployed right after deploying a broken update. Now, Rivet now shows you the last active version in a namespace with the ability to rollback in one click.
