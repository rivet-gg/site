# Launch Week 1, Day 1: Unreal Engine Module

The official Rivet Unreal Engine module allows you to deploy your multiplayer game to Rivet.

‍

Integrating Rivet with Unreal Engine just requires you to call the Rivet Matchmaker find lobby function and build a Linux dedicated server. Once you've done that, run _rivet deploy_ and we'll take it from there.
