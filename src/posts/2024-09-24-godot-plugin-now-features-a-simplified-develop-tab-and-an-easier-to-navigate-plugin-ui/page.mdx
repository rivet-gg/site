# Godot plugin now features a simplified Develop tab and an easier to navigate plugin UI

With our v2.2.0 release of the Godot plugin, we've focused on building the most intuitive multiplayer experience possible:

- A new Develop tab that merges in the old Deploy tab in to one.
- The Develop tab is vastly more intuitive to use by better indicating how the selected environment impacts Play & Deploy.
- We've also reworked how the plugin interfaces with the Rivet Hub by providing  links inline to jump to places like the Server Logs and Build List right where you need it.
- You'll also notice we've put the hub & docs links in a much more accessible location.

In addition to that, we've overhauled a number of internal functionality to run fast & reliably across all platforms.
