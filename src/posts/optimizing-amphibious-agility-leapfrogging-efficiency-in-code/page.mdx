Optimizing Amphibious Agility: Leapfrogging Efficiency in Code


Did I ask the team if I could post this? No. Its more of a "push to main" post
than a "get a review" post (update: I don't have perms, so I'll just PR without
any reviewers ðŸ˜ˆ). I won't share this blog anywhere, so if you've happened to
come across it, I hope you enjoy the frog content.

I went to the Vancouver Aquarium last month (today is May 7th), and I'm
back-dating this post to then. I saw some frogs, and since Rivet's mascot is a
frog named Greg, I thought it would be very on-topic to write a post with some
of the frogs I saw.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <Image src={frog3} alt="Frog 3" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
  <Image src={frog4} alt="Frog 4" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
</div>

These first frogs were very easy to find, which I imagine isn't great for their
stealth stat. Clearly they got a premium skin from lootboxes, which tells you a
lot about them as a player. For those who are asking, yes, these kinds of skin
are pay to win, since they add the "poisonous" effect to attacks. Not a great
look in 2024, F tier.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <Image src={frog5} alt="Frog 5" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
  <Image src={frog8} alt="Frog 8" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
</div>

These next frogs were hard to find, which puts them in the spawn-camping
catagory of player. We can tell that they've spec'd into farming XP with this
build, so I'd put their loadout in A tier.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <Image src={frog6} alt="Frog 6" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
  <Image src={frog7} alt="Frog 7" style={{ maxWidth: '45%' }} />
</div>

Finally, we have some red frogs. I'm a very big fan of red, so I can relate a
lot with them. Easy S tier. The one on the right was also well-hidden, though
this is more just because it was vibing in the dark rather than using any camo
abilities.

In conclusion, to answer my thesis in the title image: yes, frogs *are*
forever.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-around', flexWrap: 'wrap' }}>
  <Image src={frog1} alt="Frog 1" style={{ maxWidth: '70%' }} />
