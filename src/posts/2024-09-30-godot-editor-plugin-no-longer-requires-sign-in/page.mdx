# Godot editor plugin no longer requires sign in, plus template improvements

Godot plugin 2.3.0 comes with a handful of improvements for developers setting up a fresh Rivet project.

- No longer required to sign in to plugin
- Latest game version is pulled from the Rivet Builds API using the `current` tag (previously would use the most recent build deployed from the current machine)
- Template now includes a region selector
- Template now shows: status, transport, lobby ID, lobby tags, & find error
- Setup now shows loading indicator while initial SDK is generating
