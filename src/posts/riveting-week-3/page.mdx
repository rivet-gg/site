# Riveting Week 3

Updates and features from our third Riveting Week

## Exciting New Features in Riveting Week Three: Private Beta of Managed Open Game Backend

We're thrilled to announce the private beta launch of our managed Open Game Backend (OGB) at [opengb.dev](https://opengb.dev/), already powering millions of monthly players. With OGB, you can effortlessly consolidate your game servers and backend in a single managed cloud, streamlining integration with third-party tools and leveraging our open-source options for your multiplayer game servers.

### Key Benefits:

- **Efficient Backend Building:** Focus on launching your game without backend hassles.
- **Customizable Modules:** Modify and create backend modules to fit your unique needs.
- **Unified Developer Platform:** A single platform for your entire team to build single and multiplayer games.
- **Open-Source Flexibility:** No need to conform to closed-source frameworks.

### New Integrations and Modules

**Open Game Backend** now includes 2 integrations and 3 new modules to simplify game development:

- **[Infisical](https://infisical.com/):** Manage secrets like API keys effortlessly with this easy-to-use, open-source tool.
- **SendGrid:** Seamlessly send emails to users, integrated with the authentication module.
- **User Profile Pictures:** Add user profiles to your game, whether integrated with our authentication module or your own.
- **S3 Uploads:** Store and retrieve objects with ease using the AWS S3 module, perfect for user profile pictures.
- **OpenGB Engine:** Export types between modules for better code reuse.

### Indie Plan Launch

We're also launching our Indie Plan for just $9 a month, which includes:

- 6 flex servers ($48.21 in server credits)
- 3 regions
- DDoS mitigation
- Version history
- Logs & monitors
- Automatic SSL
- Analytics
- Crash reporting
- No downtime deploys & instant rollbacks
- Automatic geographic routing

Building this infrastructure independently would cost over $133 a month in subscriptions. Our technology is tailored for game developers at every scale, providing cost-effective and powerful solutions.

### Apply for Credits

Game studios can apply for up to $120,000 in credits for our managed cloud. [Apply here](https://b8v8449klvp.typeform.com/to/ZtMjRE7f).

### New Features in Godot Engine

Weâ€™ve added logs and lobbies directly accessible in the Godot Engine, ensuring you can focus on building features players love without jumping between sites and querying data.

### New Hub Design

We're excited to unveil our redesigned hub, featuring a simplified layout with international orange highlights for an enhanced user experience.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve and expand our offerings. Happy developing!
