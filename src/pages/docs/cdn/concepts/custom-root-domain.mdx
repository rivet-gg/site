# Adding a custom root domain

<Info>Rivet will be adding a simpler solution for root domains soon.</Info>

## Problem: CNAME at the root

When adding a custom domain to Rivet, you need a CNAME record to be pointed at your domain.

This works fine for subdomains, like `beta.mygame.io`. However, many domain registrars don't support adding a CNAME record at the root (i.e. `@` records), like `mygame.io`.

## Solution 1: Redirect to www

If your domain registrar supports setting up redirects, it's common to redirect from the root domain to the `www` subdomain.

1. Add `www.mygame.io` to the Rivet CDN
2. Set up a redirect from the root (i.e. `@`) to `www.mygame.io`

## Solution 2: Add your site to Cloudflare

Cloudflare supports CNAME records at the root through [CNAME flattening](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/). [Adding your site to Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/setup/add-site) will let you add a CNAME record to your root domain without any extra work.
