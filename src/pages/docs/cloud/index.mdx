<Summary>APIs used to manage your game</Summary>

For developers looking to add more layers of automation to their games on Rivet, the Rivet Cloud API provides a verbose collection of endpoints that interact with all your gameâ€™s infrastructure directly. Practically all of these will require a valid Cloud Token; See Rivet's token types page [here](/docs/general/concepts/token-types#cloud) for more info about cloud tokens.
