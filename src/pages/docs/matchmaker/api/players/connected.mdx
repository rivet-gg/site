# ⭐️ players.connected

## Description

Validates the player token is valid and has not already been consumed then
marks the player as connected.
# Player Tokens and Reserved Slots
Player tokens reserve a spot in the lobby until they expire. This allows for
precise matchmaking up to exactly the lobby's player limit, which is
important for games with small lobbies and a high influx of players.
By calling this endpoint with the player token, the player's spot is marked
as connected and will not expire. If this endpoint is never called, the
player's token will expire and this spot will be filled by another player.
# Anti-Botting
Player tokens are only issued by caling `lobbies.join`, calling `lobbies.find`, or
from the `GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin` event.
These endpoints have anti-botting measures (i.e. enforcing max player
limits, captchas, and detecting bots), so valid player tokens provide some
confidence that the player is not a bot.
Therefore, it's important to make sure the token is valid by waiting for
this endpoint to return OK before allowing the connected socket to do
anything else. If this endpoint returns an error, the socket should be
disconnected immediately.
# How to Transmit the Player Token
The client is responsible for acquiring the player token by caling
`lobbies.join`, calling `lobbies.find`, or from the `GlobalEventMatchmakerLobbyJoin`
event.  Beyond that, it's up to the developer how the player token is
transmitted to the lobby.
If using WebSockets, the player token can be transmitted as a query
parameter.
Otherwise, the player token will likely be automatically sent by the client
once the socket opens. As mentioned above, nothing else should happen until
the player token is validated.
