# Matchmaker

<Summary>Flexible matchmaker for placing players in lobbies with no wait times.</Summary>

The Rivet Matchmaker is a casual matchmaker optimized to get your player connected to your game server in under a second in the optimal region & lobby.

To integrate the Rivet matchmaker, your game needs to call these three endpoints:

- **[matchmaker.lobbies.find](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find)**: Called on the game client to return the address to connect to & the player token
- **[matchmaker.players.connected](/docs/matchmaker/api/players/connected)**: Called on the game server to notify the matchmaker the player connected & verify the player token
- **[matchmaker.players.disconnected](/docs/matchmaker/api/players/disconnected)**: Called on the game server to notify the matchmaker the player disconnected

The Rivet Matchmaker is tightly integrated with Dynamic Servers to automatically boot lobbies on-demand when players need them. Read more about how Rivet Dynamic Servers operates your game servers [here](/docs/serverless-lobbies/index).
