# Matchmaker

<Summary>Flexible matchmaker for placing players in lobbies with no wait times.</Summary>

The Rivet Matchmaker is a casual matchmaker optimized to get your player connected to your game server in under a second in the optimal region & lobby.

To integrate the Rivet matchmaker, your game needs to call these three endpoints:

- **[matchmaker.lobbies.find](/matchmaker/api/post-lobbies-find)**: Called on the game client to return the address to connect to & the player token
- **[matchmaker.players.connected](/matchmaker/api/post-players-connected)**: Called on the game server to notify the matchmaker the player connected & verify the player token
- **[matchmaker.players.disconnected](/matchmaker/api/post-players-disconnected)**: Called on the game server to notify the matchmaker the player disconnected

The Rivet Matchmaker is tightly integrated with Serverless Lobbies to automatically boot lobbies on-demand when players need them. Read more about how Rivet Serverless Lobbies operates your game servers [here](/serverless-lobbies/introduction).
