# Lobby tags

Lobby tags are an optional property that can be passed to the [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) and [`lobbies.create`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/create) endpoints to allow filtering which lobbies the matchmaker will route a player to.

To enable tags, set [`taggable`](http://localhost:3000/docs/general/config#matchmaker-game-modes-game-mode-taggable) to true.

<CodeGroup title='rivet.yaml'>
```yaml
matchmaker:
  game_modes:
    default:
      taggable: true
```
</CodeGroup>

When passed to [`lobbies.create`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/create), the newly created lobby will have the given tags. When passed to [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find), the matchmaker will attempt to return a lobby with a **superset** of the given tags. If no lobby is found, a new lobby is created with the given tags.

<CodeGroup title='Request' tag='POST' label='https://matchmaker.api.rivet.gg/v1/lobbies/find'>
```ts
// Create Rivet client
import { RivetClient } from '@rivet-gg/api';
const RIVET = new RivetClient({ token: addYourTokenHere });

// Make request
await RIVET.matchmaker.lobbies.find({
  gameMode: 'default',
  tags: {
    map: "sandstorm",
    difficulty: "hard"
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>Tags are immutable. After a lobby is created, its tags cannot be changed.</Warning>

## Example

When passed to [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) the matchmaker will only return lobbies that have a **superset** of the given tags.

Imagine this scenario where two lobbies were created with the tags and one without:

1. **Lobby 1**

   - `worldId = 123abc`
   - `map = sandstorm`

2. **Lobby 2**

   - `worldId = foobar`
   - `map = sandstorm`

3. **Lobby 3**
   - No tags

Here is what would happen with the following [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) requests:

<Note>
  This example uses
  [`prevent_auto_create_lobby`](http://localhost:3000/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies[`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find)#prevent-auto-create-lobby)
  to demonstrate the errors returned. If auto creating lobbies is enabled, cases 4 and 5 would create a new
  lobby with the given tags and cases 1-3 would create a new lobby with the given tags only if all available
  servers are full.
</Note>

1. **A [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) request with no tags**

   The matchmaker would connect the player to any of the 3 lobbies.

2. **A [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) request with the tags `map = sandstorm`**

   The matchmaker would connect the player to either lobby 1 or lobby 2.

3. **A [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) request with the tags `map = sandstorm`, `worldId = 123abc`**

   The matchmaker would only connect players to lobby 1.

4. **A [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) request with the tags `map = sandstorm`, `worldId = foobar`, `difficulty = hard`**

   The matchmaker would error because there are no lobbies with the given tags. Note that there is a lobby with two of the requested tags, but it contains a **subset** of the tags in the request, not a **superset**.

5. **A [`lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) request with the tags `map = tropic`**

   The matchmaker would error because there are no lobbies with the given tags.

## Authentication

It can be useful to allow/disallow certain tags from being used when creating or finding lobbies. This can be done via [custom external verification](/docs/matchmaker/guides/anti-botting#custom-external-verification).
