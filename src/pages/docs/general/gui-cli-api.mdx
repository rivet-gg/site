title: "The GUI, CLI, and API"
---

There are three ways to access everything in Rivet:

- <Tooltip tip="Graphical User Interface">GUI</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="Command Line Interface">CLI</Tooltip>
- <Tooltip tip="Application Programming Interface">API</Tooltip>

Our GUIs and CLIs always use the same APIs internally as the APIs that we expose to developers. This way, we can focus all of our efforts on making our APIs the highest quality possible.

## GUI

Our developer dashboard is available [here](https://hub.rivet.gg/developer/dashboard).

<Note>
	This guide requires access to the Rivet private beta.

## CLI

Our CLI is completely open source and available [here](https://github.com/rivet-gg/cli#installing).

## API

Rivet's Cloud API can be managed with your [cloud token](/general/concepts/token-types#cloud). This is the same API we use [in the CLI](https://github.com/rivet-gg/cli/blob/7f91d180f64b755956d89a3a83bfb2e77a42d72d/cli/src/commands/version.rs#L368) and for the GUI.

Our API will be available as a library soon.
