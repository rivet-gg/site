If you're **already running a multiplayer game**, Rivet can help streamline operating an existing game.

If you're **building any form of realtime, non-game software**, Rivet can help you run your realtime servers across our many regions. If you have a specific use case in mind, [please reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!
