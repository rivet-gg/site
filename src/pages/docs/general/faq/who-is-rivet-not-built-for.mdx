title: "Who is Rivet not built for?"

Single player game developers aren't going to find Rivet very helpful, since it's built primarily for multiplayer games.

However, Rivet CDN, Identities, and KV can still be used for single player games. If you find these helpful, [we'd love to hear from you](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!
