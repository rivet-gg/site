# Development tokens

## What are development tokens?

Development tokens are built to let you develop your game on your local machine with access to production APIs. When needed, API endpoints will send mock responses for development tokens.

Ideally, each developer generates a token for their local development. The token should not be committed to version control.

## Mock responses

In some cases, there's no way to return a valid response when developing on your local machine.

For example, the [`matchmaker.lobbies.find`](/docs/matchmaker/api/lobbies/find) endpoint will mock a fake address pointing to your local development server. It will also return a [development player token](/docs/general/concepts/token-types#matchmaker-development-player) that act as a real [player token](/docs/general/concepts/token-types#matchmaker-player).

## Store your token in a `.env` file

We recommend storing the development token in a `.env` file that is not committed to version control. The CLI will ask to automatically create a `.env` file with your development token when setting up your project.

If you're not familiar with `.env` files, read more [here](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#dotenv). There are libraries to load `.env` files for [most languages](https://github.com/search?q=dotenv&type=repositories).

## Generating tokens

There are a few ways to generate development tokens.

### Via CLI: `rivet init` (recommended)

Running `rivet init` will automatically check your `.env` file to see if you have a development token. If not, it will prompt you to create one automatically.

We recommend letting the Rivet CLI store this token in your `.env` for you since this is a safe place to keep it.

### Via CLI: `rivet dev create-dev-token`

You can manually generate a development token similar to `rivet init` with the command `rivet dev create-dev-token`.

### Via GUI: Rivet Dashboard

A development token can be created via the Rivet Dashboard in _My Game > API > Create Development Token_.

This is useful when generating one-off tokens where you need to override the hostname to test a multiplayer game on separate devices.

## Configuring tokens

### Via CLI with `rivet.version.toml` (recommended)

The easiest way to configure the development token is to configure it in the `rivet.version.toml` file.

By default, the Rivet CLI will create development tokens with the hostname `127.0.0.1` and use the ports configured in `matchmaker.docker.ports.*`.

To override the development hostname, set the `matchmaker.dev_hostname` property to your hostname of choice. **Do not include the port in `dev_hostname`.**

To override the development ports, each `matchmaker.docker.ports.*` property has a `dev_port` property to override the default port.

### Via GUI

Development tokens via the Rivet Dashboard at _My Game > API > Create Development Token_ have the same properties available as the CLI.
