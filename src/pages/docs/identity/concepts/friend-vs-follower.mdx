title: "Friends vs followers"

<Snippet file="wip.mdx" />

A *follow* is when one identity follows another.

A *friend* is when both identities follow each other.

Usually, when referring to a *follower*, we mean that the identities do not follow each other (i.e. a *friend*).

## Why have both friends and followers?

Most games only have the notion of a friend system (i.e. both players agree to be friends).  However, some games (especially those with esports or popular streamers) have player profiles that act like a social media page.

This system supports both traditional friend systems and social-media-like systems.
