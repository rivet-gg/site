# Lobby metrics

## Memory usage

Currently the memory usage for a lobby will not be a 1-to-1 match with memory you might observe manually from
within the runtime of your game. This is because the memory usage includes the processes that collect logs and
metrics from all lobbies.

In the future, memory overhead for running lobbies will be drastically decreased.
