# Docker root user

## What is a root user?

Linux features a user system that can be used to delegate permissions by assigning different levels of access
to users and groups, allowing for fine-grained control over file and system operations.

By default, Docker containers (which are used by Rivet to run your game), run as the root user. This can
potentially expose the host system to security vulnerabilities, as the root user has full administrative
privileges and can perform any operation on the system. This is particularly risky in a Docker environment,
where containers often need to interact with the host system.

To mitigate these risks, it's advisable to create and run containers with a non-root user. This principle of
least privilege, where a user is given the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks,
significantly enhances the security of the system as it limits the potential damage that can result from
errors or malicious actions.

<Warning>Rivet does not allow uploaded build images to run as the root user.</Warning>

## How do I run my Docker container as a non-root user?

Here are some examples of how you might add a non-root user to your Dockerfile for various Linux distros:

<CodeGroup title='Dockerfile'>
    ```docker {{ "title": "Ubuntu" }}
    FROM ubuntu

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .

    RUN useradd myuser
    USER myuser

    CMD run.sh
    ```

    ```docker {{ "title": "Debian" }}
    FROM debian

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .

    RUN adduser myuser
    USER myuser

    CMD run.sh
    ```

    ```docker {{ "title": "Alpine" }}
    FROM alpine

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .

    RUN adduser myuser
    USER myuser

    CMD run.sh
    ```

    ```docker {{ "title": "CentOS" }}
    FROM centos

    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .

    RUN useradd myuser
    USER myuser

    CMD run.sh
    ```
