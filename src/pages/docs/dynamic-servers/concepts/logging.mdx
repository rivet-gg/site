# Logging

Rivet provides a system for collecting logs from your servers automatically for free.

## Limitations

Our logs are tailored to support logging infrequent events like players joining/leaving or occasional in-game events. We don't recommend logging things that happen every tick.

| Limitation            | Value                                                                                | What happens when exceeding?              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Line length           | 1024 characters per line                                                             | Lines are truncated to 1024 characters    |
| Rate limit per server | 960 lines every 15 seconds (15 logs/s) **or** 1,200 lines every 5 minutes (4 logs/s) | Log lines are dropped until next interval |

## Why add limitations?

Most cloud providers charge [exorbitant](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/?product=log-management#products) [amounts](https://grafana.com/pricing/) of [money](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for their logging services. Developers frequently accidentally add verbose logging to their application that either (a) racks up a large bill or (b) hits a usage limit and suddenly can't read any of their logs without paying a lot of money.

Instead, Rivet provides sane limits on logging while still providing the service for free. This means that if you accidentally deploy a game with excessive logging, we'll only collect a fraction of the logs and you won't have to worry about your bill.
