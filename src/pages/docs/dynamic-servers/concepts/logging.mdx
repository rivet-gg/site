# Logging

Rivet provides system for collecting logs from your servers automatically for free.

## Limitations

Our logs are tailored to support logging infrequent events like players joining/leaving or map rotations. We don't recommend logging things that happen every tick.

| Limitation            | Value                                                                                | What happens when exceeding?              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Line length           | 1024 characters per line                                                             | Lines are truncated to 1024 characters    |
| Rate limit per server | 960 lines every 15 seconds (15 logs/s) **or** 1,200 lines every 5 minutes (4 logs/s) | Log lines are dropped until next interval |

## Why add limitations?

Most cloud providers charge [exorbandant](https://www.datadoghq.com/pricing/?product=log-management#products) [amounts](https://grafana.com/pricing/) of [money](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) for their logging services. Developers frequently accidentally add verbose logging to their application that either (a) racks up a large bill or (b) hits a rate limit and suddenly can't read any of their logs.

Instead, Rivet chooses to provide sane defaults for logging for free and ignore excessive logs. This means that if you accidentally deploy a game with excessive logging, we'll only collect a fraction of the logs.
