# Serverless Lobbies

<Summary>Auto-scaling game lobbies boot up to meet demand.</Summary>

Serverless Lobbies is the system that automatically operates and scales your game servers.

There is no API for serverless lobbies. Lobbies are created on demand when [matchmaker.lobbies.find](/matchmaker/api/post-lobbies/find) is called. Read more about the matchmaker [here](/matchmaker/introduction).
