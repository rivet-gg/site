# OpenGB

Rivet and OpenGB work together under the hood of the Rivet Godot plugin. While
developing your Godot game, OpenGB runs in the background, and you need to
configure it before you start. But why is this?

We built OpenGB to allow developers to think less about how their game is tied
to servers, but also have more control over the process if they choose.

OpenGB lets you combine **modules** ([docs](https://opengb.dev/docs/modules)) like
[lobbies](https://opengb.dev/modules/lobbies/overview), [auth](https://opengb.dev/modules/auth_username_password/overview),
or [matchmaker](https://opengb.dev/modules/matchmaker/overview) to control what
your game's backend will do. The default `backend.json` that comes with the Godot
plugin includes several modules, so let's see what they do:

```json backend.json
{
  "modules": {
    "users": {},
    "rate_limit": {},
    "tokens": {},
    "lobbies": {
      // ...
    },
    "rivet": {}
  }
}
```

The most important module that we use right when we start developing a game in
Godot with Rivet is the `lobbies` module
([docs](https://opengb.dev/modules/lobbies/overview)). This will allow Godot to
get routed to a game server by asking the OpenGB `lobbies` module to find a
server in the closest server region possible, and otherwise create one if it
doesn't exist. Or rather, that's the default behaviour of the
`lobbies` module, but it's easy to tweak if we had special conditions about the
lobby we wanted to join. This is what makes OpenGB so powerful; you're not
locked to how Rivet assumes your gameserver should work!

Other than `lobbies`, there are several other modules, so let's step through
them:

- [users](https://opengb.dev/modules/users/overview):
- [rate_limit](https://opengb.dev/modules/rate_limit/overview):
- [tokens](https://opengb.dev/modules/tokens/overview):
- [rivet](https://opengb.dev/modules/rivet/overview):
