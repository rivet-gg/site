# ⏱️ Quickstart

This guide will walk you through creating and deploying a multiplayer game with
Godot 4.2.

If you are using Godot 4.1/4.0/3.x, please be aware that some details may be
different.

## Step 0: Create a new Godot project

For this tutorial, [start a new Godot
project](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/first_look_at_the_editor.html).

## Step 1: Set up the Rivet Godot plugin

The [Rivet Godot plugin](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-godot) is available
to install via `gd-plug` or manually from the GitHub repo.

<Tabs>
  <article title='Godot Asset Library'>
    Go to the Godot Asset Library, search for "Rivet", and install the plugin.
  </article>
  <article title='gd-plug'>
    Add this line to your `plug.gd`:
    ```gdscript
    plug("rivet/plugin-godot")
    ```
  </article>
  <article title='Manual Installation'>
    1. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-godot/releases/latest)
    2. Unpack the `addons/rivet` folder into your `/addons` folder within the Godot project
    3. Enable this addon within the Godot settings `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`
  </article>
</Tabs>

Once the plugin is open, sign in to link your game to Rivet.

Next, follow the steps 1-3 in the "Setup" tab to setup a basic multiplayer game.

## Step 2: Testing Locally

Once you reach Step 4 in the plugin "Setup" tab, you'll be brought to the "Develop" tab.
From here, start a local Godot game server by clicking "Start" under the "Local
Game Server" section.

<div className='flex flex-row justify-center'>
  <Image src={imgDevelop} alt='A view of the develop tab of the Rivet Plugin' />
</div>

Now that the Godot server is running, start 

## Step 3: Deploying to Rivet

From the "Deploy" tab, select "Staging" and click "Build & Deploy".

<div className='flex flex-row justify-center'>
  <Image src={imgDeploy} alt='A view of the deploy tab of the Rivet Plugin' />
</div>

## Step 4: Test your multiplayer game

After deploying, go back to the "Develop" tab and see that the environment is set to the same environment you
just deployed to (should be "Staging"). Press "Run Project" in the top right of the Godot editor. You are now
connected over the internet through Rivet to your game!
