## TL;DR

Godot 4's multiplayer (a.k.a. "scene replication") has the foundations required to build hobbyist multiplayer games (e.g. RPC & replication), but lacks some features required to build a production-ready game (e.g. sync data types & client-side replication). It is also buggy and lacking the attention it needs to get better.

Given the recent explosive growth of the [Godot development fund](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-developer-fund/), it's bound to get better very soon.

If you're building a game as a hobby, dive head-first into Godot's multiplayer; it's fantastic. If you're making a game as a business, you'll need to prepare to contribute bug fixes to Godot, write an in-house multiplayer system & transport, or use a different engine.

## Introduction

Given the [recent](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-announce-new-pricing-and-plan-changes/) [events](https://gamefromscratch.com/developers-react-to-unity-pricing-change/) [in the](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-price-change-fallout-keeps-getting-worse/) [world of Unity](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-developers-fight-back/), we've received a lot of questions about Godot as a viable alternative to Unity for multipayer games.

Godot's multiplayer (a.k.a. "scene replication") was rewritten from the ground up for Godot 4.0, released just [6 months ago](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/). It's still very young, but is a very promising foundation.

We're going to be comparing developing multiplayer games in Unity with Godot's [high-level multiplayer API](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html). We'll be looking specifically at using Unity with the [Fish-Net library](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/), since it's arguably the [most comprehensive free option](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bj5uLdnxZYlJykBg3Qd9BNOtvE8sp1ZQ4EgX1sI0RFA/edit#gid=233715429) compared to [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/) and Unity's native [NGO](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/tutorials/get-started-ngo/).

## Why use an engine for multiplayer games?

Engines are a great choice for multiplayer games because they provide a lot of the core functionality (e.g. physics, platform support, transports) required to build a multiplayer game out of the box. It also helps with strong code reuse between client & server.

However, many multiplayer games are written using a custom backend from scratch. This is why Unity supports a [low-level transport library](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@2.0/manual/index.html).

While this guide explores specifically Godot's high-level API, you can also (a) use Godot on both the client & server with your own multiplayer system, or (b) use Godot on the client with your own custom backend.

### Transports

**Status:** Mature

### Ownership/authority

**Status:** Mature

[Fish-Net's ownership](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/ownership) and [Godot's authority](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html#class-node-method-set-multiplayer-authority) models are nearly identity.

### RPCs

**Status:** Mature

[Godot's RPCs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html#remote-procedure-calls) will feel familiar to developers who have used [Fish-Net's RPCs](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/remote-procedure-calls).

| Fish-Net                                    | Godot                                           |

### Synchronizers

**Status:** Good enough

Developers use to Fish-Net's [sync types](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/synchronizing) will find that Godot's default [MultiplayerSynchronizer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html) lacks a lot of features, but is still a pleasant experience to use.

#### Sync types

Fish-Net supports many types of primitive synchronization out of the box (`SyncVar`, `SyncList`, `SyncHashSet`, `SyncDictionary`, `SyncTimer`).

By default, Godot's synchronization only supports synchronizing primitives (`float`, `string`) and simple types (`Vector2`, `Color`, etc). However, [`allow_object_decoding`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenemultiplayer.html#class-scenemultiplayer-property-allow-object-decoding) can be enabled to allow synchronization of more complex types. This is not recommended, since it creates the potential for RCE exploits.

To manually synchronize your own complex types, it's possible to use a getter/setter to encode a [`PackedByteArray`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packedbytearray.html), as seen [here](https://godotengine.org/article/multiplayer-changes-godot-4-0-report-4/#:~:text=and%20then%20in%20your%20player%20script%3A).

```
# Node state
var weapon: int = 0
var ammo: int = 100

# Custom encoding & decoding
var sync_state:
	get:
		var buf = PackedByteArray()
		buf.resize(6)
		buf.encode_half(0, position.x)
		buf.encode_half(2, position.y)
		buf.encode_u8(4, weapon)
		buf.encode_u8(5, ammo)
		return buf

	set(value):
		assert(typeof(value) == TYPE_RAW_ARRAY and value.size() == 6)
		position = Vector2(value.decode_half(0), value.decode_half(2))
		weapon = value.decode_u8(4)
		ammo = value.decode_u8(5)
```

You'll likely find yourself writing repetitive encoding & decoding code if building a game with complex data types (e.g. board games, strategy games).

<Tip>
  For the full list of common types that can be synced, see
  [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/4df80b0e629e25653a706f6721c13a1f9d1da368/core/io/marshalls.cpp#L1117)
  where `p_full_objects` is `false`.
</Tip>

#### Send rate

Fish-Net supports [configuring send rate for individual properties](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/synchronizing/attributes#:~:text=it%20has%20changed.%20*%2F-,public%20float%20sendrate%20%3D%200.1f%3B,-%E2%80%8B).

Godot also supports customizing send rate with [`MultiplayerSynchronizer.replication_interval`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html#class-multiplayersynchronizer-property-replication-interval) (for synced properties) and [`MultiplayerSynchronizer.delta_interval`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html#class-multiplayersynchronizer-property-delta-interval) (for watched properties). However, this is only supported at the node level; you can't customize for each property individually. You can work around this issue by creating multiple separate `MultiplayerSynchronizer` nodes.

#### Visibility/observers

Fish-Net has a robust system for automatically filtering what entities get replicated using [`ObserverCondition`](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/observers/custom-conditions). They include [6 conditions available out of the box](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/tree/main/Assets/FishNet/Runtime/Observing/Conditions) that you can enable with one line of code.

Godot lets you either (a) [set visibility for specific peers](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html#class-multiplayersynchronizer-method-set-visibility-for) or (b) [provide a custom callback for filtering peers](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html#class-multiplayersynchronizer-method-add-visibility-filter). The visibility filter is similar to Fish-Net's `ObserverCondition`, but requires more boilerplate code to implement.

#### Configuring reliability

Fish-Net supports configuring reliability for each variable individually.

Godot approaches this slightly differently. Variables can either configured to "synced" (i.e. be sent each update, sent unreliabilty) or be "watched" (i.e. be sent only when changed, sent reliably).

<Image src={imgGodotSyncWatch} alt='Godot sync/watch' />

#### Listening for changes

Fish-Net supports the `OnChange` to listen for when a property changes.

Godot implements this using GDScript's native getters & setters.

### No-code multiplayer prototyping

**Status:** Proof of concept

One of the core goals of Godot's replication system was to allow for ["(almost) no-code prototyping"](<https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3459#:~:text=allow%20for%20(almost)%20no-code%20prototyping.>) of multiplayer games. They achieve this by enabling you to enable replication just by adding [MultiplayerSynchronizer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayersynchronizer.html) and [MultiplayerSpawner](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_multiplayerspawner.html#class-multiplayerspawner) nodes, but you'll still need some boilerplate code to connect & start a server.

There's no equivalent in Fish-Net.

It's debatable how much time this saves in the long run, but the effort to lower the barrier of entry for building network replication without comprimising flexibility is admirable.

#### Client-side prediction, lag compensation, and predicted spawning

**Status:** Nonexistent

If a multiplayer game feels choppy on a high-latency connection, it's not going to be fun to play for most players.

Fish-Net shines when it comes to all the extra goodies required to make your game feel buttery smooth. They provide:

- [client-side prediction](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/client-side-prediction/version-1/using-client-side-prediction) (v2 is a WIP)
- [Predicted spawning](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/spawning/predicted-spawning) out of the box.
- [Transform extrapolation](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/components/network-transform#smoothing) ([requires Pro](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/master/pro-and-donating))
- [Lag compensation](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/guides/lag-compensation) ([requires Pro](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/master/pro-and-donating))

Godot 4's multiplayer replication is very young, so none of this is provided out of the box. You need to do a lot of work to implement these features yourself.

### Authentication

**Status:** Mature

Both [Fish-Net's authenticator](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/components/authenticator) & [Godot's authentication callback](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_scenemultiplayer.html#class-scenemultiplayer-property-auth-callback) support the same functionality. Fish-Net does provide some [handy authenticators out of the box](https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishNet/tree/21b7ef4186cc7dba7ae0ad1ca8223118f557e13a/Assets/FishNet/Demos/Authenticator/Scripts), but they're not difficult to re-implement in Godot.

### Priority

**Status:** Non-existent

Network prioritizing is important for games with a lot of data to send (e.g. open world games), but need to ensure that the most important data is sent first. Alex Forsythe has a great explanation of how this system works in Unreal Engine [here](https://youtu.be/JOJP0CvpB8w?t=551&si=_Go17YW6keAliujz).

Both Fish-Net and Godot lack support for prioritizing RPC and synchronization updates. Tuning replication intervals can help with this, but it's not a perfect solution.

## License

**Status:** Killer

Always make sure to closely inspect the license of software you include in your game.

Fish-Net uses a [non-standard license](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/master/restrictions). Their website states:

> There are no restrictions for personal and commercial use.

Fish-Net provides a [Pro version](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/master/pro-and-donating) which has its own limitations.

Fish-Net requires using Unity. [Do with that what you will.](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-price-change-fallout-keeps-getting-worse/)

Godot is licensed under the [permissive MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license/), which is an [OSI approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses/). [Read more about the MIT license.](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-mit-license/) Godot is also governed by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/) non-profit. All that to say: if Godot does the job for your game, it's a very safe bet in terms of licensing.

Ask your lawyer or do your own research if you have more questions.

## Stability

**Status:** Needs work, but will improve

Fish-Net is a mature library that has been used in many games. The developer takes stability and [breaking changes very seriously](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/#no-break-promise) and [offers LTS releases](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/#long-term-support).

Godot's multiplayer is still very young. While trying to recreate [Fish-Net's benchmark](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/general/performance/benchmark-setup) in Godot for this blog post, I could no connect more than ~40 CCU to a server no matter the configuration & platform. For comparison, Fish-Net's lowest benchmark result clocks 100 CCU. One of the issues I ran in to was [8 months old](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/70505?descriptionFromFileType=Attached+File). The Godot GitHub has [66 open issues](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+label%3Atopic%3Anetwork) relating to networking bugs, [31 of which are over a year old](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+label%3Atopic%3Anetwork+created%3A%3C2022-08-17+).

It's important to stress that Godot is an open-source project ran by a non-profit organization with developers who are sacrificing high-paying jobs to build Godot. It's is astonishing how much they've been able accomplish with limited resources.

At the time of writing, the [development fund alone now provides $47k USD/mo](https://fund.godotengine.org/) to the Godot Foundation, most of which game within the last 5 days since the Unity Runtime fee announcement.

## Performance

**Status:** TBD

Godot's performance deserves a blog post of its own.

From a high level, Unity benefits from:

- **Language** C# is _generally_ faster than GDScript ([but it's getting better](https://godotengine.org/article/gdscript-progress-report-typed-instructions/))
- **Maturity** Unity has a long history of performance optimizations, while Godot 4 — which rewrote most of the engine — is still very young

Godot benefits from:

- **Architecture** Godot's engine is architected to be an event-based engine, meaning slower user scripts are only run in response events instead of every frame whenever possible ([read more](https://godotengine.org/article/why-isnt-godot-ecs-based-game-engine/#:~:text=The%20scene%20system,from%20the%20user.)), while Unity frequently relies on lots of C# logic called every update
- **C++ multiplayer** Multiplayer system is written in C++ (Fish-Net is written in C#) which has the potential to be faster (needs benchmarks)
- **Multilingual** Godot add-ons can be written in any language (GDScript, C#, C++, Rust), allowing you to selectively optimize performance-critical code
- **Contributions** Anyone can contribute to Godot's engine, meaning that performance issues can be fixed by anyone

I recommend reading [this overview of optimization strategies](https://godotengine.org/article/why-isnt-godot-ecs-based-game-engine/#optimization) for the Godot engine. [Juan Linietsky] recently posted a [great thread on X](https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1703328476424548756) with resources about Godot's architecture.

More detailed benchmarks between Godot & Fish-Net need to be ran.

## Support

### Community

**Status:** Semi-mature

Fish-Net has an active Discord and are responsive to issues on GitHub. There is no forum and Reddit posts frequently go unanswered.

Godot has a well organized Discord, a very active Reddit, and developers are responsive to GitHub issues. However, questions about multiplayer frequently go unanswered because few developers have extensive experience with it. Additionally, the huge influx of developers from Unity seem to have overwhelmed the Discord & Reddit with questions without enough people to answer them. This will likely improve over time.

### Commercial

**Status:** TBD

Most large studios require good support around their tooling to make sure they can focus on shipping their game instead of fixing bugs in other peoples' code.

Fish-Net offers [professional support](https://fish-networking.gitbook.io/docs/master/business-support).

Godot also offers [commercial support](https://godotengine.org/contact/#:~:text=from%20conventional%20means.-,commercial%20support,-While%20we%20don).

The SLA for both are unclear.

## Documentation

Fish-Net has good inline documentation and guides on their website. I do still find myself frequently diving in to the source code to understand how things work.

[Godot's documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) is very well organized, but lacking on specifics about multiplayer. For example, I had to dive in to the source code a few times to understand what types can be synced.

## Prior art

**Status:** Preliminary

At the time of writing, only 1 of the games [featured on their showcase](https://godotengine.org/showcase/) supports multiplayer. ([That game runs on 3.1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/ac7sw9/early_look_precipice_in_godot_31/)) Given Godot 4 which includes the new multiplayer system is very young, it's not surprising that there aren't many multiplayer games built with Godot.

Godot games using Godot 4's scene replication:

- [Liblast](https://codeberg.org/Liblast/Liblast)
- [Drift](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2159650/Drift/) ([RPC only](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/136l48l/comment/jirir32/))
- [Object Wars](https://noiros.itch.io/object-wars) ([RPC only](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/117a1z2/comment/j9cbwx9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))

You don't have to use Godot's multiplayer system if you're building a multiplayer game with Godot.

You're able to either:

- Use Godot on both the client & server with your own multiplayer system & transport
- Use Godot on the client with your own custom backend (e.g. C++, NodeJS, etc)

### Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine has a fantastic native multiplayer replication system and is very mature. It's a great alternative for Unity developers developing high-end games.

However, Unreal Engine is much more complicated and heavy weight than Godot; it's not a great choice for most casual games.

Unreal Engine also requires a [5% royalty](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/release) after $1 million in revenue, while Godot is a permissively licensed open-source project. You'll never pay a dime to use Godot.

### HTML5 & JavaScript

HTML5 is a popular alternative for casual multiplayer games, since you can run JavaScrip on both the frontend and backend (e.g. NodeJS, Bun, Deno). This lets you use shared logic between the client & server. However, there is no widely used JavaScript multiplayer system that works similar to Fish-Net.

### Other Engines

GamesFromScratch has a great [list of alternative games engines](https://gamefromscratch.com/unity-alternatives-in-2023/) for developers using Unity. However, only [GameMaker](https://beta-manual.yoyogames.com/#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FRollback%2FCreating_Multiplayer.htm), [Flax](https://docs.flaxengine.com/manual/networking/high-level.html?tabs=code-csharp), and [O3DE](https://docs.o3de.org/docs/user-guide/networking/multiplayer/overview/) natively support high-level multiplayer.
