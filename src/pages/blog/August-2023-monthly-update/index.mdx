We are excited to launch a ton of new features during the month of August. First though, we want to thank you all for your support on Hacker News with our show HN post on our open-source game server management and over 1200 Github stars in less than a week.

## Unity

Rivet finally supports Unity, the last major game engine we wanted to support in our lineup. Rivet now supports all major engines: Unity, Unreal, and Godot; and will support more engines in the future.

## Custom Lobbies

The matchmaker now supports the ability to create custom lobbies for your game, solving the issue of private game modes, mini-games, or other unique game server functionality.

## External Verification

You can now use your own logic to allow and reject matchmaking requests for custom account systems, internal anti-botting mechanism, and restricting users from joining private game servers.

## Lobby State

Lobbies now broadcast their current status, which which will be helpful build royale style games and richer insights within your game. 

## Faster cold starts

Game servers launch faster now from 10s to around 3s for Unity. This greatly reduces the wait time for gamers waiting to join and the ability for Rivet to quickly scale during surge periods.

## Java and Go clients

Run game servers on Rivet using the Java and Go clients, or use game engines like LibGDX and Ebitengine.

## Open-source improvements

* Rivet now supports multiple file providers including S3, Backblaze, MinIO
