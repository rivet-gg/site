<Snippet file="wip.mdx" />

This guide will walk you through creating and deploying a multiplayer game with Unreal Engine.

This guide was written using Unreal Engine 5.1.1. This process is similar if using Unreal Engine 4. If you're using a different version of Unreal Engine and need help, don't hesitate to [reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH).

## Overview

Unreal Engine provides fantastic multiplayer capabilities out of the box. We'll be using Unreal's built-in networking to build a server-authoritative multiplayer game on top of Rivet.

Running an Unreal game on Rivet requires building a standalone client and a dedicated server.

<Info>
    **How does Rivet compare to Epic Online Services and Steam Sockets?**

    Rivet is intended to help run authoritative multiplayer servers. We do not support peer-to-peer networking yet.
	
	Read more about [authoritative vs peer-to-peer networking](/general/concepts/authoritative-vs-p2p).

    If you want high-performance networking, mobile games, large lobbies, or to prevent cheating, peer-to-peer networking is not a good choice. 
</Info>

## Step 1: Prepare Unreal Engine

### Download the Unreal Engine cross-compilation toolchain

[Download here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine/)

- Make sure you download the version corresponding to your Unreal version
- You may have to restart

### Install Visual Studio prerequisites

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-development-environment-for-cplusplus-projects-in-unreal-engine/)

### Download the Unreal Engine source code

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/downloading-unreal-engine-source-code/)

- Join GitHub team
- Clone UnrealEngine repo

### Build the Unreal Engine editor

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/)

1. Install Visual Studio prerequisites
   - TODO: See Setting Up Visual Studio > C++ Tools
1. `.\Setup.bat`
1. `.\GenerateProjectFiles.bat`
   - You'll see a warning: `Some Platforms were skipped due to invalid SDK setup:`
   - Make sure that `Linux` is not listed here. If so, then step 1 was not done correctly.
1. Open UE5.sln
1. Wait for _Indexing folder UnrealEngine_ to finish
   - You can see this by clicking the messae tab in the bottom left
1. Set _Solution Configuration_ to _Development Editor_
1. Set _Solution Platform_ to _Win64_
1. Right click _UE5_ target in right sidebar and click _Build_
   - Takes 10-40 minutes depending on your hardware
1. Right click on _UE5_ in the sidebar and click _Debug > Start New Instance_
1. Unreal Engine is built to at `UnrealEngine\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor`
   - Create a shortcut somewhere for quick access in the future

## Step 2: Setup the Unreal Engine project

We'll be using the third-person template from Unreal Engine since all of the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other networked Unreal Engine game.

<Warning>
  If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your
  project is version controlled.
</Warning>

### Create third person template (or bring your project)

Use the C++ version. While Rivet also works with Blueprints, we haven't put together a guide for that yet.

### Test locally

1. Configure PIE networking configuration
1. Run the project
1. Check that you can see your players running around

### Build Linux server

[See official guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/setting-up-dedicated-servers-in-unreal-engine/)

- You may need to restart Unreal after building the client and server to show new targets
- May need to run _Tools > Refresh Visual Studio Project_ after building client and server

---

## Step 3: Setup Rivet project

### Install Rivet CLI

### Initiate project

---

## Step 4: Integrate with Rivet

### Add project dependencies

Update _Source/MyProject/MyProject.Build.cs_ to add `"Http"`, `"Json"` and `"JsonUtilities"` to `PublicDependencyModuleNames`. For example:

```csharp Source/MyProejct/MyProject.Build.cs
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class MyProject : ModuleRules
{
	public MyProject(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
	{
		PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "HeadMountedDisplay", "EnhancedInput", "Json", "JsonUtilities" });
	}
}
```

### Copy Rivet module

### Add token to config

### Build connection UI

- Create menu scene
- Set menu scene game mode to GameModeBase

![Set game mode base](/images/unreal-set-game-mode-base.png)

### Build connection code

### Test locally

### Configure testing

- Level Editor > Play

---

## Step 5: Publish

### Write server Dockerfile

### Build server

### Build client

### Deploy

### Ways of running your game

<AccordionGroup>
	<Accordion title="Quick iteration: PIE + listen server">
		This setting is useful for quick iteration.

		Open *Edit > Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Play* and update the following settings:

		- **Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server**: False
		- **Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server**: False
		- **Multiplayer Options > Play Net Mode**: Listen Server
		- **Multiplayer Options > Run Under One Process**: True
		- **Client > Play Number Of Clients**: >= 2
		- **Server > Server Map Name Override**: _Empty_

		<Warning>
			Be aware that running as a listen server may behave differently than with a dedicated server if [actor authority](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/networking-overview-for-unreal-engine/#networkroleandauthority) is not handled correctly.

			Using a listen server means that all actors have `Role == ROLE_Authority`. In production, actors will have `Role == ROLE_SimulatedProxy`. Read more [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/actor-role-and-remoterole-in-unreal-engine/).

			Check your functionality with PIE + standalone server if you think you might be having issues.
		</Warning>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Testing authority: PIE + standalone server">
		This setting is useful for:

		- Testing the offline -> online flow of a user joining a server
		- Testing actor roles are handled correctly with a dedicated server (i.e. as close to production as possible)

		Open *Edit > Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Play* and update the following settings:

		- **Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server**: False
		- **Multiplayer Options > Play Net Mode**: Standalone
		- **Multiplayer Options > Run Under One Process**: True
		- **Client > Play Number Of Clients**: >= 2
		- **Server > Server Map Name Override**: _Empty_
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Testing for release: standalone client + standalone server">
		TODO

		This is useful for release testing locally.

		- Build debug client
		- Build debug server
		- Bake client
		- Bake server
		- Open server binary
		- Open client binary
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Testing on Rivet's servers: standalone client + Rivet server">
		TODO

		This is useful for testing Rivet functionality in production.

		- Publish to Rivet
		- Use a public token on localhost
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why can't I use 'Launch Separate Server'?">
	Ideally, you would be able to test a dedicated server from Unreal Engine's editor with these settings:

	- **Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server**: true
	- **Multiplayer Options > Play Net Mode**: Standalone
	- **Multiplayer Options > Run Under One Process**: True
	- **Server > Server Map Name Override**: /Game/ThirdPerson/Maps/ThirdPersonMap

	However, there's a bug in Unreal Engine that causes the spawned standalone clients to use the *Server Map Name Override*, which makes this useless.

	Read more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/pnquou/question_main_menu_multiplayer/).

## Troubleshooting

### Port 7777 already taken for development

```
netstat -aon | findstr "7777"
```

```
taskkill /F /PID MY_PID_HERE
```

### Empty level/no lighting when running with 2+ clients in PIE

This issue can be mitigated by running separate processes when testing your game:

1. Navigate to _Editor Settings > Play_
1. Set _Multiplayer Options > Run Under One Process_ to _false_

### Standalone client automatically goes to the wrong map

1. Navigate to _Editor Settings > Play_
1. Clear the field _Server > Server Map Name Override_

<Info>
	If _Server Map Name Override_ is not empty but grayed out, you need to:

	1. Enable _Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server_
	1. Clear _Server > Server Map Name Override_
	1. Disable _Multiplayer Options > Launch Separate Server_
</Info>
