# ⏱️ Crash Course

<WorkInProgress />

This guide will walk you through creating and deploying a multiplayer game with
Godot 4.

<Warning>If you are using Godot 3, please be aware that some details may be different.</Warning>

## Overview

Godot provides great multiplayer capabilities out of the box. We'll be using
Godot's built-in networking along with Rivet's Godot plugin to build a server-authoritative multiplayer game on
top of Rivet.

Godot supports ENet, WebSocket, and WebRTC transports. We'll be using ENet for
this tutorial, but it's easy to swap out.

## Step 1: Initialize project

<InstallCli />

We'll be using a modified version of Godot's [multiplayer
bomber demo](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/networking/multiplayer_bomber) 

<WhatDoesRivetDo />

Clone [Rivet's example repo](https://github.com/rivet-gg/examples). The bomber
demo is in `godot/bomber`. Note, this project already has everything
implemented, so you can switch to the `TODO` branch to follow along.

### Configure Rivet

Copy the following to `rivet.yaml`:

```yaml rivet.yaml
engine:
  godot:

matchmaker:
  max_players: 12
  regions:
    lnd-atl: {}
    lnd-fra: {}
  docker:
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    ports:
      default:
        port: 10567
        protocol: "udp"
  game_modes:
    default: {}
```

You can find more information about the Rivet config file [in our
documentation](https://rivet.gg/docs/general/config).

### Link project

Run the following command to link your game to Rivet. If you haven't already,
create a new game at this step.

```bash
rivet init --recommend
```

## Step 2: Install the Rivet plugin in Godot

[Installation
instructions](https://github.com/rivet-gg/plugin-godot/tree/main#installation).
Once you've set up the plugin, you should see a Rivet panel in the bottom left.

From here, you'll need to link your game to Rivet by signing in. If you haven't already,
you can create a new game on the Rivet Hub at this step.

## Step 3: Update game code

Add the following to the top of `_ready` in `gamestate.gd`:

```text gamestate.gd
func _ready():
	RivetHelper.start_server.connect(start_server)
	RivetHelper.setup_multiplayer()

	# ...etc...
```

Move the code to start the server:

```text gamestate.gd
func start_server():
	print("Starting server on %s" % DEFAULT_PORT)

	peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
	peer.create_server(DEFAULT_PORT, MAX_PEERS)
	multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer(peer)
```

Update `join_game` to ask Rivet which lobby to connect to:

```text gamestate.gd
func join_game(new_player_name):
	player_name = new_player_name

	RivetClient.find_lobby({
		"game_modes": ["default"]
	}, _lobby_found, _lobby_find_failed)


func _lobby_found(response):
	RivetHelper.set_player_token(response.player.token)

	var port = response.ports.default
	print("Connecting to ", port.host)

	peer = ENetMultiplayerPeer.new()
	peer.create_client(port.hostname, port.port)
	multiplayer.set_multiplayer_peer(peer)

func _lobby_find_failed(error):
	game_error.emit(error)
```

### Test locally

Open the Rivet panel in the bottom left and click _Start Server_. Then click the
play button in the top right to start the client. You should be able to join the
lobby.

## Step 4: Deploy to Rivet

### Write Dockerfile

Write the following `Dockerfile`

```docker Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/rivet-gg/images/godot:4.2 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mkdir -p build/linux \
    && godot -v --export-release "Linux/X11" --headless ./build/linux/game.x86_64

FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt update -y \
    && apt install -y expect-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /app/build/linux/ /app

# Unbuffer output so the logs get flushed
CMD ["sh", "-c", "unbuffer /app/game.x86_64 --verbose --headless -- --server | cat"]
```

### Deploy game

Run the following command to deploy your game to Rivet:

```bash
rivet deploy -n prod
```

### Create public token

We've been using development tokens up until this point. Now that our game is
deployed, we can create a

Create a public token in the Rivet Dashboard:

<Image src={imgCreatePublicToken} alt='Create public token' />

Now pass that token to your game by adding the following code to `gamestate.gd`:

```text gamestate.gd
func _ready():
	# Paste token here
	RivetClient.set_token("pub_prod.xxxx.xxxx")
```

Run the client again and it will connect to the production servers. Remove this
line when developing locally.
