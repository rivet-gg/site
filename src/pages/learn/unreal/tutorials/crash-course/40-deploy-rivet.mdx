# Step X: Deploy to Rivet

## Deploy to Rivet

In the root of the project, run the following command:

```bash
rivet deploy -n prod
```

This will deploy your project to your game's production namespace.

## Test with remote game server locally

Now that your game server is running on Rivet, you can test using a production namespace token.

1. Create a new namespace token as described [here](/general/concepts/handling-game-tokens#public-namespace-tokens).
2. Update the token in the _Entry_ widget blueprint where you created `MY_TOKEN` in the previous step.
3. Play the project and click your _Connect_ button. Check that you are able to see the other player run around.

Your game is now up and running on Rivet!

## Build & distribute client

You can build & distribute the game client as you like. Rivet provides a [CDN](/cdn/introduction) to make this easy.

Make sure to change _Rivet Token_ to [public namespace token](/general/concepts/handling-game-tokens#public-namespace-tokens) when distributing builds, like we did in a previous step. You can also [use Unreal's config files](\learn\unreal\concepts\token-config.mdx) to configure the token.
