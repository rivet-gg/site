# ⏱️ Crash Course

Unreal Engine provides great multiplayer capabilities out of the box. We'll use Unreal's built-in networking to build and deploy a server-authoritative multiplayer game on top of Rivet.

<Accordion title='How does Rivet compare to Epic Online Services and Steam Sockets?'>
    Rivet is intended to help run authoritative multiplayer servers. We do not support peer-to-peer networking yet.

    Read more about [authoritative vs peer-to-peer networking](/docs/general/concepts/authoritative-vs-p2p).

    If you want high-performance networking, mobile games, large lobbies, or to prevent cheating, peer-to-peer networking is not a good choice.
