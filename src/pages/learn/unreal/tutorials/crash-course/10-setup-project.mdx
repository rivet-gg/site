## Step X: Setup Unreal Engine project

We'll use the third-person template from Unreal Engine. All the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other Unreal Engine games.

<Warning>
  If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your project is version controlled before
  making any changes.
</Warning>

### Create project from template (or bring your own project)

1. Create a third-person template with the C++ version. We'll create a guide for using Blueprints instead of C++ soon.
2. Set _Quality Preset_, _Starter Content_, and _Raytracing_ to your preferences.
3. Click _Create_.

### Add server target

We need to add a target so you can compile your game as a dedicated server to run on Rivet.

Replace `MyGame` with your project's name.

```csharp
using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MultiplayerTest2ServerTarget : TargetRules
{
	public MultiplayerTest2ServerTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
	{
		Type = TargetType.Server;
		DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
		IncludeOrderVersion = EngineIncludeOrderVersion.Unreal5_1;
		ExtraModuleNames.Add("MyGame");
	}
}
```

## Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry

We must authenticate with the GitHub Container Registry to pull the Unreal Engine Docker image. This contains the source code for Unreal Engine for Linux, enabling us to build the dedicated server.

Follow [these](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-with-a-personal-access-token-classic) instructions.

Once complete, run:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/epicgames/unreal-engine:dev-5.2.1
```

Replace `5.2.1` with the version of Unreal Engine you're using.

This will take some time to download.

	<Accordion title='Why does this take so long to download?'>
		This step downloads a copy of Unreal Engine for Linux and its source code. You'll only have to do this once.

	<Accordion title='What if I want to build Unreal Engine from source?'>
		It's also possible to build your dedicated server by [building Unreal Engine from source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/). This requires many more prerequisites with a complicated & error prone setup process, so we use Epic's Docker image instead.

		However, this may be required if using a fork of Unreal Engine. Please [reach out](https://discord.com/invite/BG2vqsJczH) if you need help making this work with Rivet.
