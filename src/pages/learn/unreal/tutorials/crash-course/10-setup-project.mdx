## Step X: Setup Unreal Engine project

We'll use the third-person template from Unreal Engine. All the components come with networking out of the box. These steps also apply to any other Unreal Engine games.

<Warning>
  If you're following this guide on an existing project, ensure that your project is version controlled before making any changes.
</Warning>

### Create project template (or bring your project)

1. Create a third-person template with the C++ version. We'll create a guide for using Blueprints instead of C++ soon.
2. Set _Quality Preset_, _Starter Content_, and _Raytracing_ to your preferences.
3. Click _Create_.

<Image src={imgCreateThirdPerson} alt='Third person create dialog' />

### Add server target

### Set up play configuration for testing multiplayer

We will test the networking locally before deploying it.

1. Press the three dots next to the play button and click _Advanced Settings_ to open the _Play In_ settings.
<Image src={imgPlaySettings} alt='Play settings' />

2. Scroll down to _Multiplayer Options_. Update the following settings:
	- **Play Net Mode**: Play Standalone
	- **Run Under One Process**: False
<Image src={imgMultiplayerOptionsSettings} alt='Multiplayer options settings' />

3. Update the number of players to at least 2.
<Image src={imgNumberPlayers} alt='Change number of players' />

3. Press the green play button or press _Alt + P_.

4. Validate that you can run around and see your movement synchronized between windows.
