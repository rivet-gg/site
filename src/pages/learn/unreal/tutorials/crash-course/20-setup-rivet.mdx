## Step X: Setup Rivet project

### Install Rivet CLI

[Installation instructions](https://github.com/rivet-gg/cli)

### Initiate project

Run the following in your project's directory:

```bash
rivet init --recommend --matchmaker --matchmaker-port 7777 --matchmaker-dockerfile 'Dockerfile'
```

Don't enable the CDN for this guide. Don't write the token to .env.

Save the development token that's provided to you. You'll use this in a few steps.

### Update _rivet.version.toml_

Update your _rivet.version.toml_ file to look like this:

```toml rivet.version.toml
[matchmaker]
	max_players = 32

[matchmaker.regions]
	lnd-atl = {}
	lnd-fra = {}

[matchmaker.docker]
	dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
	ports.default = { port = 7777, dev_port = 17777, protocol = "udp" }

[matchmaker.game_modes]
	default = {}
```

`dev_port` is set to 17777 because that's the default port that Unreal Engine runs on. This can be configured in _Edit > Editor Preferences > Level Editor > Play > Server > Server Port_.
