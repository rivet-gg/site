# Graceful Exit

Game servers often need to run code when they are about to shut down. This is called a "graceful exit". This is useful for saving data, cleaning up resources, and notifying players.

Under the hood, Rivet uses [Unix signals](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~ccc/dfc/dfc/signals.html#:~:text=A%20signal%20is%20a%20message,send%20it%20a%20SIGHUP%20signal.) to notify the game server that it will be shut down soon.

1. Rivet sends a `SIGTERM` asking the server to shut down gracefully. Your server should exit as soon as possible after receiving this signal.
2. If the server does not exit within 30 seconds, Rivet will force the server to shut down.

## Examples

### Godot

Godot does not natively support this (see [#1361](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/1361)). To use GDExtension as a workaround, see [here](https://github.com/NathanFlurry/demo-godot-unix-exit).

### Unreal Engine

[`UEngine::PreExit`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UEngine/PreExit/)

### Unity

[`MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationQuit()`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.OnApplicationQuit.html)

### Node.js

```javascript
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
    console.log('Exiting')
    process.exit(1);
});
```
