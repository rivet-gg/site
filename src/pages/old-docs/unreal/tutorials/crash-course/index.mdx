# Overview

**Estimated time: 15 minutes**

Unreal Engine provides great multiplayer capabilities out of the box. We'll use Unreal's built-in networking to build and deploy a server-authoritative multiplayer game on top of Rivet.

## Goals

- Deploy & distribute a multiplayer Unreal Engine dedicated game server to Rivet
- Build a basic menu screen for a multiplayer game
- How to test multiplayer games locally

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Unreal Engine 5 GitHub access](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github)
- [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
  - This guide was written using Unreal Engine 5.2.1.
- About 60 GB of free space (for Unreal Engine Linux build)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='How does Rivet compare to Epic Online Services and Steam Sockets?'>
        Rivet is intended to help run authoritative multiplayer servers. We do not support peer-to-peer networking yet.

        Read more about [authoritative vs peer-to-peer networking](/docs/general/concepts/authoritative-vs-p2p).

        If you want high-performance networking, mobile games, large lobbies, or to prevent cheating, peer-to-peer networking is not a good choice.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Does Rivet support Unreal Engine 4?'>
        This guide is built for Unreal Engine 5.

        If you're using a different version of Unreal Engine and need help, please [reach out](https://discord.gg/BG2vqsJczH)!

    <Accordion title='Do I need to build the editor from scratch?'>
        You do **not** need to build the Unreal editor yourself to follow this guide.

        Rivet's build system uses Unreal Docker containers to simplify development & deployment.

    <Accordion title='What if I want to build Unreal Engine from source instead of using Docker?'>
    	It's also possible to build your dedicated server by [building Unreal Engine from source](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/). This requires many more prerequisites with a complicated & error prone setup process, so we use Epic's Docker image instead.

    	However, this may be required if using a fork of Unreal Engine. Please [reach out](https://discord.com/invite/BG2vqsJczH) if you need help making this work with Rivet.
